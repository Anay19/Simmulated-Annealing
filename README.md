# Simmulated-Annealing

The Simulated Annealing Algorithm is a probabilistic optimization technique inspired by the annealing process in metallurgy. It is used to find the global optimum solution for an optimization problem by iteratively improving upon an initial solution.
Algorithm Steps

    Initialize the temperature and the initial solution: Set the initial temperature and randomly generate an initial solution to the problem.
    Generate a new solution: Randomly perturb the current solution to generate a new solution.
    Calculate the change in the objective function value: Determine the difference in the objective function value between the current and the new solution.
    Accept better solutions: If the new solution is better than the current solution (i.e., it has a lower objective function value for a minimization problem or a higher objective function value for a maximization problem), accept the new solution as the current solution.
    Accept worse solutions with a probability: If the new solution is worse than the current solution, calculate the acceptance probability based on the change in the objective function value and the current temperature. The acceptance probability is higher for smaller differences in the objective function value and higher temperatures.
    Randomly accept or reject the new solution: Randomly accept or reject the new solution based on the calculated acceptance probability.
    Update the temperature: Update the temperature according to a cooling schedule, gradually decreasing the temperature as the algorithm progresses.
    Repeat until stopping criterion is met: Repeat steps 2-7 until the temperature reaches a minimum value or a stopping criterion is met, such as a maximum number of iterations or a convergence criterion.

Features

    The Simulated Annealing Algorithm is a metaheuristic optimization technique that can escape local optima by accepting worse solutions with a certain probability, allowing for a more thorough exploration of the solution space.
    It is an effective algorithm for solving complex optimization problems with many local optima, where traditional optimization methods may get stuck in local optima.
    The algorithm is inspired by the annealing process in metallurgy, where metals are heated and then cooled slowly to increase their structural properties.
